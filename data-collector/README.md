A tool for collecting data produced and consumed by Minecraft. This handles
collecting data from datapacks and from the vanilla jar.

<!-- TODO: Decide if the vanilla jar downloading should be another package. I think not, because its data needs to be shepharded into this form anyway -->

This package is part of the
[`mcfunction-langserver`](https://github.com/Levertion/mcfunction) project.
